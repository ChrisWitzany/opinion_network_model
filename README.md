## Requirements
You need Conda to easily setup the environment, such that you can run the code.

## Installation
```shell
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate op_spread
$ pip install requirements.txt
```

This will create a new Conda environment named **op_spread**, so make sure that you always activate the environment before trying to run the code:

```shell
$ conda activate op_spread
```

Now the environment is all set up and you're good to go.
